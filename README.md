# Interests:

I love database design, I'd love to create some new projects involving a database. I gained a lot of experience by creating my own program communicating via a MySQL database server. 

Further I adore the language C, it is perfect (apart the damn segfaults). C++ is a great language, I'd love to learn new stuff at it. Still waiting to learn new!
